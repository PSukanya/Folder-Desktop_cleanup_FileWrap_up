SHORT_DESCRIPTION:
-----------------
The project : Folder_Cleanup/Filw_wrap_up moves the necessary files / groups similar files created or modified on the current day & moves them to a destination. 

AIM:
---
This helps in :
 Referencing the old file repository for later use.
 Improves the speed of the system after a perfect desktop cleanup on a daily basis.
 Easy access to report based files on grouping and placing them to the same folder.

SOURCE CODE's description:
--------------------------
This menu based python code can be placed in a task scheduler and can be run on a daily basis.
The source and destination can be obtained from the user during run time or can be hard coded in the program.
Based on the user's input, the required files are moved.


A dictionary stores the file path and the last modified time of the files.
A comparison is made between the last modified time of the files and the present date and time.
Once they match all the files are moved to the destination folder.

INSTALLATION:
------------
The source code is written in python, hence installation of python would be feasible.

I have also placed an '.exe' file.
